# **arduino_light-dependent-bolt-latch**

## THIS IS AN UNFINISHED WORK IN PROGRESS

Using Arduino, measure the amount of light present using a photocell. In response to daylight levels, a dc-motor configured 
in such a way mechanically to operate a sliding barrel-bolt back and forth (lock/unlock) will be triggered.

This is a derrivative piece based on the work of David Naves found [here](https://davenaves.com/blog/interests-projects/chickens/chicken-coop/arduino-chicken-door/# "Dave Nave's blog"). 
A large debt of gratitude is owed to him for this project.
